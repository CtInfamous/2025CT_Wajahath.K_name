Canvas Crawler

My Game 

Description
Canvas Crawler plunges players into a chilling, adrenaline-fueled quest through a haunted house teeming with danger and mystery. As Hibikasu, a determined operative on a high-stakes mission, players must navigate eerie corridors and shadowy chambers to locate three elusive treasure chests before rival forces do. Armed with an axe and a quiver of arrows, Hibikasu must fend off relentless mobs of ghosts and venomous spiders that guard the house’s secrets. Each of the 12 levels intensifies the challenge, introducing smarter enemies, trickier terrain, and more complex puzzles. Players can sprint, jump, slide, and block attacks with precision, using intuitive controls—W to move forward, S to retreat, Spacebar to leap, M to punch, and K to swing their weapon. The game blends fast-paced combat with strategic exploration, demanding quick reflexes and sharp decision-making. With every gem collected and enemy defeated, Canvas Crawler draws players deeper into its haunted world, testing their courage and skill in a race against time and terror.

Getting Started - Basics of the Game
Starting out in Canvas Crawler drops you into a side-scrolling 2D haunted house where every step forward is a fight for survival. As Hibikasu, your mission is clear: locate three massive treasure chests before anyone else does. The controls are simple and responsive — W to move forward, S to step back, Spacebar to jump, M to punch, and K to swing your axe. You’ll face off against ghosts and spiders from the very beginning, and you’ll need to use your ability to block attacks and shoot arrows to stay alive. The first level introduces you to the core mechanics and enemy behavior, giving you just enough breathing room to get your bearings before the intensity ramps up. With each level, the haunted house grows more hostile, demanding quick reflexes and sharp timing as you fight your way toward the chests and complete your mission.
